The user \r\ncan move the snake in four possible directions: up, down, left or right. The user must avoid \r\ndying which occurs when the snake head makes contact with either of the four walls or any part \r\nof its own body. The object of Snake is to eat as many mice as possible. A mouse is represented \r\nas a dot or square on the screen and is eaten when the head of the snake makes contact with it. \r\nEvery time a mouse is eaten:\r\n\r\n1. the snake becomes one unit longer\r\n\r\n2. the player’s score goes up\r\n\r\n3. the snake’s speed increases \r\n\r\n4. a new random mouse is generated on the screen\r\n\r\n##About the Project\r\nFor more details on this project, see:\r\n\r\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/kcanida/Snake/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n* [Developer Guide](https://github.com/kcanida/Snake/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n* [Contact Us](https://github.com/kcanida/Snake/wiki/Contact-Us)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
